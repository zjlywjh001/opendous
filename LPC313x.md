This board has been prototyped but is not very useful.

The LPC313x-DIY has limited functionality as it is a 2-layer single-sided components board made to 8mil-8mil-20mil (trace-clearance-minimum\_drill) specification.

The relevant [KiCAD](http://www.lis.inpg.fr/realise_au_lis/kicad/) design files can be found through [SVN](http://code.google.com/p/opendous/source/checkout) in the `/Abandoned_Designs/LPC313x-DIY/` directory.

A PCB of this design can be purchased at cost through [BatchPCB](http://batchpcb.com/index.php/Products/44279).
