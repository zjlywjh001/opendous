The relevant [KiCAD](http://www.lis.inpg.fr/realise_au_lis/kicad/) design files can be found in [SVN](http://code.google.com/p/opendous/source/browse/trunk/Current_Designs/MultiAdaptor/).

This adaptor has multiple overlapping footprints for any occasion: up to 28 pin SOIC/SO (1.27mm pitch), up to 28-pin SSOP/TSSOP (0.65mm pitch), up to four SOT23, up to three SC70, one MSOP-10 (0.5mm pitch), one SOT223, and one SOT-143.  All in a 0.8" wide DIP board.  The header pins are staggered to allow press-fitting them while soldering.

A PCB of this design can be purchased at cost through [BatchPCB](http://batchpcb.com/index.php/Products/44123).
